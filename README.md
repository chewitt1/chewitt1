### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Fourth Year College Student excited to start developing and contributing!

# ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- M&D Cleaning Website
- Portfolio Website V2

# ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning
- Agile
- React.JS

# ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding what projects to contribute to as a beginner

#âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite game is Sims 3 (feel free to recommend some other types of games, I'm trying to diversify my gameplay)
